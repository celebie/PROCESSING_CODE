# PROCESSING_CODE
Centralizing my archived Processing code to GitHub.  All of this code was written using Processing v2, some libraries will not work with Processing version 3.

Each folder should contain a .png file showing the output of the sketch.

NOTE:  These sketches date back a few years, some are utilities, and some just don't work with the latest versions of Processing.  There only a few, but be aware.

Help yourself to the code, have fun, and hit me up sometime if like it or want to collaborate.
