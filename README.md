# PROCESSING_CODE
Centralizing my archived Processing code.

Each folder should contain a .png file showing the output of the sketch.

NOTE:  Some sketches date back a few years, some are utilities, and some just don't work with the latest versions of Processing.  There only a few, but be aware.

Help yourself to the code, have fun, and hit me up sometime if like it or want to collaborate.
